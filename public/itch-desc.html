    <p>[You open your messaging app...]</p>
    <p>Talent Manager Manager: So you're the new Talent Manager? I'm the Talent Manager Manager, so that means I'm your
        manager.</p>
    <p>Talent Manager Manager: Welcome to Kuro Company, the blackest of black companies.</p>
    <p>Talent Manager Manager: We’re just like the other companies, except we don’t lie about our intentions.</p>
    <p>Talent Manager Manager: Here, we’re all about business. And that means numbers. No time for things like morals,
        artistic integrity,
        and forming human connections.
    </p>
    <p>Talent Manager Manager: This is cutthroat business in a saturated, hypercompetitive market. Every time you
        stream, we need you to
        reach our Viewer Goal by any means necessary.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>Talent Manager Manager: If you don’t reach that goal, you’re fired. Not my call, it’s upper management’s policy.
    </p>
    <p>Talent Manager Manager: Honestly, you should just give up now. It’s not like you’ll reach these insane goals
        anyway.
    </p>
    <p>Talent Manager Manager: But don’t kill yourself. Or talk about suicide or self harm. That wouldn’t be advertiser
        friendly, and
        nothing matters more than that sweet, sweet ad revenue.
    </p>
    <p>Talent Manager Manager: And don’t think about quitting, either. You still owe us for the model we’ve provided for
        your first Talent.
    </p>
    <p>Talent Manager Manager: If you’re feeling overwhelmed, you can try out our Mindfulness Booth&trade; for a few
        minutes. But not right
        now.
    </p>
    <p>Talent Manager Manager: When you’re ready, click the Stream icon on the desktop and I’ll walk you through your
        first stream.</p>
